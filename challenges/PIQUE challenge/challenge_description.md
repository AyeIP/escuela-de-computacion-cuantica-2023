## Challenge Statement

Make an educational resource on quantum computing can use a project, a presentation, a video game, a game, anything that manages to understand and explain a topic of quantum computing, the delivery format can be an ipnb file or a markdowm file.



    Objective: The primary goal is to create an educational resource related to quantum computing.

    Delivery Format Options: The resource can take various forms, including a project, a presentation, a video game, a board game, or any other suitable medium that can effectively help people understand and explain a topic related to quantum computing.

    Acceptable File Formats: The final product can be submitted in either an "ipnb" (likely referring to Jupyter Notebook) or a "markdown" file format. These formats are commonly used for creating and sharing documents, code, and presentations.

    Dissemination: The completed project or resource will be uploaded and shared with a wider audience. It will be made available on the website "https://fullstackquantumcomputation.tech/."

    Social Media Promotion: In addition to the website, the resource will also be promoted through the social networks of the community. This likely means that the creators will use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or other social media sites to share and publicize the educational resource.
